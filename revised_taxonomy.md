# Research-Based Peptide Taxonomy

## Revised Categories
14 research areas based on study evidence:
- **Weight Loss** - Metabolism, fat oxidation, appetite regulation
- **Healing** - Tissue repair, wound healing, recovery
- **Muscle** - Muscle growth, strength, recovery
- **Longevity** - Longevity pathways, cellular repair
- **Cognitive** - Memory, focus, brain function
- **Energy** - Mitochondrial function, cellular metabolism
- **Sleep** - Sleep quality, circadian rhythm
- **Stress** - Anxiety reduction, stress response, mood
- **Sexual** - Sexual function, libido
- **Cosmetic** - Skin health, appearance, tanning
- **Immune** - Immune function, antioxidant, detoxification
- **Gut Health** - Digestive health, gut barrier protection
- **Neural** - Neuroprotection, neurodegeneration (shorter than "Neuroprotection")
- **Diabetes** - Blood sugar, insulin sensitivity, diabetes management

## Key Changes Made

**Removed weak associations:**
- Semax → Muscle (insufficient evidence)
- Oxytocin → Immune (very preliminary)
- 5-Amino-1MQ → Energy (speculative)
- DSIP/Epithalon → Energy (not primary mechanism)

**Reordered based on research strength:**
- Selank: Stress (anxiolytic) is primary, not cognitive
- Glutathione: Immune/detox is primary research focus
- MOTS-c: Cellular health through mitochondrial pathways is primary

**Terminology updates:**
- "Cellular Health" instead of "Anti-Aging" (more precise, less regulatory risk)
- "Neural" instead of "Neuroprotection" (shorter, cleaner)
