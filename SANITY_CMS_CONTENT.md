Note: Large bitmap backgrounds were replaced with CSS gradients for performance. Use the following CSS classes instead of images:
- `bg-aurora-hero` for the hero
- `bg-aurora-card` for feature cards
- `bg-aurora-marquee` for the marquee section
Optionally add `has-grain` to apply a subtle grain overlay.

Integration mapping
- hero: `*[_type=="hero"][0]{headline, subheadline, ctaText, ctaHref}` → replaces hero title, supporting text, CTA.
- featureCard: `*[_type=="featureCard"]{title, body, "iconUrl": icon.asset->url} | order(order asc)` → fills the three feature cards; icons will replace the `<img>` if present.
- marqueeSection: `*[_type=="marqueeSection"][0]{title, subtitle, quotes[]->{compound, quote, scientist, organization, source}}` → `window.__NA_QUOTES__` for marquee.
